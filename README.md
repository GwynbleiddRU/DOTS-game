# Dots Game
ðŸŽ² A logic board game for two players, combining positional strategic planning with tactical permutation of options. The game is played on a flat game field divided into cells of the same size. Players take turns placing dots of two colors at the intersections of the lines. The goal is to surround the opponent's dots by closing them around with a continuous chain of your own dots.

## Game Description
The game is played on a flat field divided into parallel and perpendicular lines of equal size cells. Players take turns placing dots of two colors at the intersections of these lines, called points. The point in which the dot is placed remains occupied until the end of the game, previously placed dots cannot be moved or removed from the field. All points on the field are equal.

The edge of the field is a limiting factor and does not directly participate in the game process. The size of the field is determined by the number of points vertically and horizontally and can vary widely. A field size of 39 points horizontally and 32 points vertically (the size of a standard notebook sheet) is considered traditional.

The goal of the game is to surround the opponent's dots. Surrounding means creating an area on a certain part of the playing field enclosed within a continuous, non-intersecting chain of dots of the same color, no more than one cell apart horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. At the same time, dots of another color must be present in this area at the moment of closure (one or more). In this case, the area is colored in the color of the dots that created the surrounding, and the opponent's dots inside it are disabled from further play, counting as captured, and go to the credit of the one who surrounded them.

Have fun playing the game! ðŸŽ‰
